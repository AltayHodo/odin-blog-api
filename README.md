**Blog App**
Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React + Typescript (might come back and use Tailwind.css for styles), Vercel for deployment
- Backend: Node and Express + Typescript, PostgreSQL with Prisma, Render for deployment (I'm using the free version which will probably deactivate)

In this project, I made an API only backend following REST principles, and used it to serve 2 separate frontends. One frontend is for general users, and one is for authors of the blog.
